# Brazil-medical-appointment-analysis


This project is a part of my submission for the Alx-t/Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Programme
#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

### Introduction
**Why do patients not keep their appointments?** An individual makes a doctor appointment, receives all the instructions and doesnt show up for the appointment. **Who or what do we attribute the blame to?** This project analyses the possible reasons of patients not showing up for their medical appointments)

#### Dataset
The dataset which contains informations on medical appointments collected in Brazil was obtained from the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments.


### Methods Used
* Data Cleaning and Wrangling
* Data Visualization
* Feature Extraction

### Technologies
* Python
* Numpy, Matplotlib
* Pandas, jupyter
* HTML 

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Conclusions

### Results
* Out of 110,526 patients who scheduled appointments, 88207(over 79.8%) patients showed up while 22319(about 20.2%) patients did not show up.
* Females make up about 65% of the dataset while males account for the remaining 35%.
* There isnt much disparity among the genders in showing up for appointments.
* Tuesday and Wednesday records the highest number of fixed date for appointment, Saturday records the lowest number of appointments and there are no appointments on Sunday.
* Seniors(ages 20 to 64) and toddlers(ages 2 to 4) have the highest tendency to show up for their appointments while teenagers(ages 13 to 20) have the lowest.
* Individuals with goverment welfare(scholarship) seem to actually show up less than those without welfare.
* Patients diagnosed with hypertension show up for their appointments than those who arent diagnosed with hypertension.
* Patients diagnosed with diabetes show up for their appointments than those who arent diagnosed with diabetes.
* There is some difference in the rate of showing up for appointments among the different categories of the physically-challenged(Handicapped).
* SMS Reminders are not very effective in getting patients to show up for their appointments.


### Limitations
* The entire dataset is a subset of the population and may possess some form of bias which may affect the inference from the analysis.
* Most of the variables are categorical,this hinders some bivariate and multivariate analysis that could have provided more insights.
* There are some findings that seem counter-intuitive. The SMS reminders was expected to show increase in patients showing up for their appointments but reverse was the case.
